# Naive Bayes Classifier – Spam vs ham(not spam) Detection

This repository contains a simple practice notebook where Naive Bayes classification is applied to detect spam vs ham messages. The aim is to understand the working of the algorithm and practice basic implementation using Python.

## 📌 What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, assuming independence between features. It is commonly used in text classification problems like email spam detection.

In this notebook:
- Dataset is preprocessed and analyzed
- Naive Bayes model is trained
- WordClouds are created for spam and ham text

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries used:
  - `pandas` – for data handling  
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations  
  - `scikit-learn` – for implementing the Naive Bayes classifier  
  - `matplotlib` – for plotting  
    

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib wordcloud
